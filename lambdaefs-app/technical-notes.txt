## ## Issue: "Docker not found" when deploying containers to AWS.

The tutorial I followed to deploy and EC2 instance as a Jenkins server was incomplete. The instance did not include Docker. So, the instance could not build and deploy Docker containers to AWS through Jenkins.

Follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ to fix this issue.

## ## Issue: /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

There are many articles on how to fix this issue. Most commonly, and in this case, I added Jenkins to the docker group:  sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins.

Not sure if I needed to but I restarted the jenkins and docker services.
